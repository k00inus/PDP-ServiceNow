# PDP-ServiceNow

## Project Objectives
1. Create an application for Students to set Personal Development goals.

2. Epic 1: Create functionality for Students to add new Personal Development Goals (PDPs), as well as set the Start Date and End Date, Status and Priority, as well as creating Tasks associated with the Goals.

3. Epic 2: Create functionality for Students and Trainers to track the progress of the PDPs, based on number of tasks completed towards that goal (e.g. if 3/4 tasks are completed, it will show as 75% complete). Create view to show Students Goals based on priority, viewable for Students and Trainers.

4. Epic 3: Create functionality for the Trainers to leave feedback associated with each Goal, and make this viewable by the Student.

5. Epic 4: Create functionality to send notifications to Trainers when a Student completes a Goal or a Task.
